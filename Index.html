    <p>Metro Shadows Entertainment is a game developing company owned by, Max Bergerson. Metro Shadows Entertainment is currently working on their first game which is a RPG called, Blood and Power. Blood and Power is a story based RPG where you play as a character named, Zeriof. Zeriof is a magic user who uses shadow magic to bash his way through monsters and enemies. Like most RPG games Blood and Power allows the main character to acquire followers through his/her journey. Zeriof is a skilled magic user trained in the arts of shadow magic. Most of Zeriof's past is shrouded in complete mystery. The other characters that have been finished are, Lucia, a female magic user trained with the element of fire, and Eltois a female magic user trained in the arts of water/ice magic.
